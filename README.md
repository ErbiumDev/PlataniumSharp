Fortnite Proxy Based Universal Private Server
<br>
Name is subject to change.
# How it works
## Basic Explanation
This Project uses FiddlerCore to Create a Proxy server that redirects all Fortnite Requests to our custom C# Backend as well as Launch Fortnite without EAC/Battle Eye!

### Proxy
Using [Telerik's FiddlerCore](https://www.telerik.com/fiddlercore) this Project creates a Proxy Server that redirects Fortnite Requests to our own C# Backend (more info on that below).

(Removed For Now)Unlike the Lawin Server executable this **DOES NOT** Use the System Proxy and makes it easy to use other applications while still running the launcher!
### Backend
**WIP**
