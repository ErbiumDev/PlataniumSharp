<br>
Work's on Latest and possibly a few versions before Byfron
<br>
Inspired by [Lawin Server](https://github.com/PsychoPast/LawinServer)
# How it works
## Basic Explanation
This Project uses FiddlerCore to Create a Proxy server that redirects all Fortnite Requests and can also Launch Fortnite without EAC/Battle Eye!
## More In-Depth Explanation
### Proxy
Using [Telerik's FiddlerCore](https://www.telerik.com/fiddlercore) this Project creates a Proxy Server that redirects all fn Requests to a Backend on port 5595 (bc Neonite works best)

For some reason you need to retrust the fiddler cert everytime

Crashes randomly on a WS error (Partially fixed)
